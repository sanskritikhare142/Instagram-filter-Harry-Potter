# Instagram-filter-Harry-Potter
An instagram filter that creates a virtual scenario of the Sorting Ceremony held every year in the Great Hall of the Hogwarts School Witchcraft and Wizardry, but due to COVID 19, a mask is now must as apart of the house uniform. On tapping the screen, a house will be allotted randomly and the normal mask will get replaced by the house mask. Sound effects, sprint sheets and a sorting hat has been added to mimic the real sorting ceremony.

## Usage
Download the zip file and open the "Sorting Ceremont COVID19.arpjor" file to view the project. To try the filter yourself, download the Spark AR player on your phone, connect your phone via USB cable to your laptop and choose the 'Test on device' option in the project.

Tap the screen to get sorted in the Hogwarts houses and get your house mask.
